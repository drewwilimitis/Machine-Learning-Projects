## Decision trees

An implementation of a random forest from building up individual decision trees


## Dimensionality reduction

Illustrating the steps of Principal Component Analysis and other dimensionality reduction approaches using the scikit-learn package for manifold learning. Visualizing some manifold learning algorithms like t-SNE, Isomap, and MDS applied to the MNIST dataset
