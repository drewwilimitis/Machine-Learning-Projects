# ML_projects

Projects based on exercises from the textbook "Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow" 

## Plotting decision regions

Experimenting with various support vector classification hyperparameters on several different toy datasets, and visualizing classification decision regions with the mlxtend library

## Decision trees

An implementation of a random forest from building up individual decision trees

## Dimensionality reduction

Illustrating the steps of Principal Component Analysis and other dimensionality reduction approaches using the scikit-learn package for manifold learning. Visualizing some manifold learning algorithms like t-SNE, Isomap, and MDS applied to the MNIST dataset

## Kernel Trick

Attempting to explain and illustrate kernel methods in non-linear support vector machines

## Ensemble methods/Random Forest

Applying some ensemble methods like voting classifiers, bagging/pasting, AdaBoost, and gradient boosting and trying to visualize the collective decision regions on sample datasets

## Spectral clustering/embedding

Some background on laplacian eigenmaps and spectral clustering/embedding
